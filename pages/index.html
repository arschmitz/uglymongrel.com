In addition to hosting my own plugins and widgets here ( mostly for jQuery mobile ). I have also decided to provide a download builder so that any jquery mobile plugin or widget hosted here can be bundled into a custom build of jQuery mobile using the same download builder as on jquerymobile.com</p></brick>
